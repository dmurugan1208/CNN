MNIST Handwritten Digit Classification using
Convolutional Neural Networks
MNIST Dataset:
- The MNIST database (Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology
database) is a large database of handwritten digits that is commonly used for training
various image processing systems. It has a training set of 60,000 examples and a test
set of 10,000 examples for handwritten digits with a fixed dimension of 28X28 pixels
(grayscale images with only 1 channel). The goal is to correctly identify digits (i.e., to
classify a given image of a handwritten digit into one of 10 classes representing integer
values from 0 to 9).
- This dataset is considered to be the "hello world" dataset for Computer Vision and
Deep Learning. For your reference, top-performing models are deep learning
convolutional neural networks that achieve a classification accuracy of above 99%, with
an error rate between 0.4% and 0.2% on the hold-out test dataset.
- The MIST dataset is provided in the folder “dataset”. To load the dataset, please refer
to the given Jupyter notebook “read-mnist-dataset.ipynb”.
